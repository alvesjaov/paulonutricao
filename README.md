# Locate & Nourish

Landing page and lead-generation site for Paulo Virgílio, clinical and sports nutritionist serving Bahia. The project is built with Vite, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components.

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the development server**

   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Build for production**

   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Preview the production build (optional)**

   ```sh
   npm run preview
   ```

## Project Structure

- `src/` contains the React application, UI primitives, hooks, and page components.
- `public/` holds static assets that are served as-is.
- `vite.config.ts`, `tailwind.config.ts`, and `tsconfig*.json` store tooling configuration.

## Deployment

Any static host that supports Vite builds will work (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, Azure Static Web Apps). Run `npm run build` and deploy the generated files from `dist/` to your provider of choice.
